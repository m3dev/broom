**broom** is a Kubernetes Custom Controller designed to gracefully handle Out of Memory (OOM) events in CronJobs by dynamically increasing memory limits.

It offers the following features:

* **Dynamic Memory Limit Adjustment**: Automatically increases the memory limit of containers that experience OOM events within CronJob specs.

* **Flexible Memory Adjustment Methods**: Users can choose between addition and multiplication methods for increasing memory limits.

* **Automatic Job Restart**: Optionally, broom can restart the failed jobs with updated spec for recovery.

* **Flexible Targeting**: Allows specifying target CronJobs using combinations of Name, Namespace, and Labels.

* **Slack Notification Integration**: Provides webhook notifications to Slack, informing users about the results of updates and restarts.

## Description

### How it works
When a `phase: Failed` Pod is detected, the reconciliation loop iterates as follows:

<img src="https://github.com/m3dev/broom/assets/60843722/df5219f3-d30f-47e9-84ef-a8c045cf1c1f" width="50%">

Upon identifying a Pod terminated due to `reason: OOMKilled`, the controller traces back through the `ownerReferences` from Pod to Job to CronJob.
Once the controller identifies the relevant CronJob, it prepares a modified specification with relaxed memory limits (`spec.jobTemplate.spec.containers[].resources.limits.memory`), such as doubling the original limit.
Subsequently, the controller updates the specification of the CronJob with the modified memory limits.
Optionally, the controller can restart the failed Job once using the updated memory limits. Finally, the controller sends a notification to Slack with the following content:

### Configuration

The controller can be configured using a `Broom` custom resource, which allows users to specify the following parameters:

```yaml
apiVersion: ai.m3.com/v1alpha1
kind: Broom
metadata:
  name: broom-sample
spec:
  target:
    name: oom-sample
    labels:
      m3.com/use-broom: "true"
    namespace: broom
  adjustment:
    type: Mul
    value: "2"
    maxLimit: 250Mi
  restartPolicy: OnSpecChanged
  slackWebhook:
    secret:
      namespace: default
      name: broom
      key: SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
    channel: "#alert"
```

* `target` <small>(optional)</small> : Target CronJob conditions. If not specified, the controller will target all CronJobs in the cluster.
  * `namespace` <small>(optional)</small> : Namespace of the target CronJob.
  * `name` <small>(optional)</small> : Name of the target CronJob.
  * `labels` <small>(optional)</small> : Labels to filter the target CronJobs.

* `adjustment` <small>(<font color="red">required</font>)</small> : Memory limit adjustment parameters.
  * `type` <small>(<font color="red">required</font>)</small> : Adjustment method. Choose between `Add` and `Mul`.
  * `value` <small>(<font color="red">required</font>)</small> : Adjustment value. For `Add`, it is the value to add to the current limit (e.g., `100Mi`). For `Mul`, it is the multiplier to apply to the current limit (e.g., `"2"`, must be double-quoted).
  * `maxLimit` <small>(optional)</small> : Maximum memory limit to set.

* `restartPolicy` <small>(<font color="red">required</font>)</small> : Policy for restarting failed Jobs. Choose among `Never` (no restart), `OnOOM` (restart when OOM CronJob is detected), and `OnSpecChanged` (restart only when OOM CronJob is detected and the memory limit is updated).

* `slackWebhook` <small>(<font color="red">required</font>)</small> : Slack notification integration.
  * `secret` <small>(<font color="red">required</font>)</small> : Kubernetes Secret containing the Slack webhook URL.
    * `namespace` <small>(<font color="red">required</font>)</small> : Namespace of the Secret.
    * `name` <small>(<font color="red">required</font>)</small> : Name of the Secret.
    * `key` <small>(<font color="red">required</font>)</small> : Key containing the webhook URL.
  * `channel` <small>(optional)</small> : Slack channel to send notifications. If not specified, the notification will be sent to the default channel.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.21.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/broom:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified. 
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment. 
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/broom:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin 
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following are the steps to build the installer and distribute this project to users.

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/broom:tag
```

NOTE: The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without
its dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE> to install the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/broom/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
# kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3dev/broom/main/dist/install.yaml
```


**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
